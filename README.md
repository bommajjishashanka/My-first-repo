# My-first-repo
This is my first GitHub repository, created to practice version control, Git commands, and project organization. The repository will include sample projects, test scripts, and documentation as I build my skills in SQL, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).It serves as a personal learning space to explore data workflows.
